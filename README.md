# 🚗 Vehicle Violation Management System

## 📖 Project Description
The **Vehicle Violation Management System** is a backend project built using **ASP.NET Core** that provides a complete solution for managing vehicle violations.  
The system enables **Admins** and **Officers** to manage violations, while **Vehicle Owners** can register, view their violations, and pay fines securely.  

The project focuses on applying **Clean Architecture principles** and several design patterns to ensure scalability, maintainability, and high performance.

## 🏗️ Project Architecture
The project follows **Clean Architecture** with separation of concerns into multiple layers:
- **Domain Layer** → Core business entities and rules.
- **Application Layer** → CQRS (Commands & Queries), Specifications Pattern, DTOs, Business Logic.
- **Infrastructure Layer** → Database (EF Core, SQL Server), Repositories, Unit of Work, Redis, Stripe integration.
- **Presentation Layer (API)** → ASP.NET Core Web API exposing endpoints.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **.NET 8 / ASP.NET Core**
- **Entity Framework Core** (Code-First with Migrations)
- **SQL Server** (Relational Database)
- **Redis** (Distributed Caching)
- **Stripe API** (Online Payment Processing)
- **Identity Core** (Authentication & Authorization)
- **Swagger / Postman** (API Testing & Documentation)

---

## 🎨 Design Patterns Implemented
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** → Separation of read/write operations.
- **Specification Pattern** → Flexible querying logic.
- **Unit of Work** → Manage transactions effectively.
- **Generic Repository** → Reusable and maintainable data access layer.
- **Dependency Injection** → For loose coupling and testability.
